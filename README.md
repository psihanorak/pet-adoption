# PET-ADOPTION #
## Overview ##
The adoption page lists animals in categories such as big cats, dogs, and horses. 

## AC ##
**WHEN** the user is on the page they will see color coordinated buttons at the top of the page that will filter out animals according to categories.   
**THEN** once the specified animal button is clicked the animal of that category will filter and the color associated to that type will also remain consist of that type.  

## Dev Notes ##
- An array of pets with image, name, color, special skills, and type will be displayed on the card.
- An event listener will be created to filter the animals when the buttons are clicked.
- The first DOM string will be used to create the information for the individual pet.
- The second DOM string will loop the pet array creating the pet cards.
